= Trying out and developing with Collaboration Engine

Collaboration Engine is licensed as https://vaadin.com/license/cvrl-1.0[Commercial Vaadin Runtime License (CVRL)].
You can freely test it out and develop applications with it, without charge. When you take your app to production, you need a valid subscription. 
To get started, follow the https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/ce/tutorial.html[tutorial on adding Collaboration Engine to your project] to learn about the features.

While your app is in development mode, you can freely use all the features of Collaboration Engine without restrictions. 
There is no need for a license or a separate trial. 
Development mode is the default mode of a Vaadin application and is used when not explicitly configured to do a production build.
