= Installing Vaadin Collaboration Engine
:sectnums:


Collaboration Engine is a dependency that you add to your Vaadin project.

In the project's pom.xml file, add the `vaadin-prereleases` repository. Under the `<repositories>` tag, add the following:

[source, xml]
----
<repository>
    <id>vaadin-prereleases</id>
    <url>https://maven.vaadin.com/vaadin-prereleases</url>
    <releases>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
    </releases>
    <snapshots>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
    </snapshots>
</repository>
----

Add Collaboration Engine as a dependency, under the `<dependencies>` tag in the root (and *not* the one under `<dependencyManagement>`):

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>collaboration-engine</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
----

Consult the https://github.com/vaadin/collaboration-engine/releases[releases page] to find the version number of the latest release, e.g. `1.0.2`.
