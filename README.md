# Collaboration Kit

Collaboration Kit is an integrated, simple way to implement real-time collaboration, such as simultaneous editing or a chat.

You can build collaborative features directly into Vaadin Flow applications: don't rely on 3rd party tools, when you can directly integrate these features â€“ giving you security, reliability, and complete control over all your sensitive data.
